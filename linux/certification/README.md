 This directory contains my individual coursework that I completed for the WithYouWithMe Linux Fundamentals Course. WithYouWithMe are a social impact company, solving the digital skills shortage by building new talent from overlooked communities.

 The course includes Linux System Administration, file and directory qwnership and access privilege operations. I added more advanced commands from this course to additional_commands.txt.
