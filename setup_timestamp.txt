To setup timestamps in Visual Studio Code, you need to create a json code snippet file. Click on View
in the top menu then Command Pallette... and type Snippets: Configure Snippets, click on that and then
you can select New Global Snippets file. Type for example snippet.json. Then it will open up a file
called 'snippet.json.code-snippets" and you can put your code there. For example:

{
	"Do something": {
	"prefix": "d",
	"body": [
		"Text text text"
	],
	"description": "Something"
	}

}

Then afterwards you will need to access the keybinding file.

Control + Shift + P
Type: Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)
This opens the keybindings.json file where you can define custom shortcuts.

Add a keybinding code as below:

{
  "key": "alt+d",
  "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
  "when": "editorTextFocus",
  "args": {
    # this has to be the exact name of the snippet, first line, the part before ': {'
    "name": "Do something"
  }
}
